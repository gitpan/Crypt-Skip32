Crypt-Skip32 version 0.06
=========================

Crypt::Skip32 is a 80-bit key, 32-bit block cipher based on Skipjack.
The Perl code for the algorithm is a direct translation from C to Perl
of skip32.c by Greg Rose found here:

  http://www.qualcomm.com.au/PublicationsDocs/skip32.c

Crypt::Skip32 differs from other encryption algorithms in that it has
a fairly small cipher block of 32 bits (4 bytes).  This allows
Crypt::Skip32 to be used to encrypt numeric values with a short
encrypted text length (useful for encoding ids in URLs and the like).
